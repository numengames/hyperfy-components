## Available Components

### Respawn System
The respawn component tracks player positions and automatically returns them to their last safe position when they fall below a configurable threshold. [Learn more](./respawn/README.md)

### Teleport Auto
An interactive component that implements automatic teleportation functionality based on proximity. Teleports players when they enter a configurable radius around the component. [Learn more](./teleport-auto/README.md)
